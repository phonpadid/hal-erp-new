## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The Description Is What The Document Says It Is For

The description cell SHALL be the document's `document_line.description` values, in line order,
joined with `; `, omitting empty ones.

When no line carries a description, the cell SHALL fall back to a form value chosen by
`form_field.field_name`, in this order:
1. The document's purpose/reason field: the first of `purpose`, `purposes`, `reason`, `reson`,
   `objective` (case-insensitive) that has a recorded value. These are the names the printed
   letter reads its ເຫດຜົນ from.
2. Otherwise, the first text-typed form value in `form_field.sort_order` (`doc_field_value.field_value`
   of a `form_field` whose `field_type` is `text`) whose field is not the letter's subject field. That
   field is found exactly as the letter finds it: by name (`subject` or `topic`), else by the label
   `ເລື່ອງ`.

The field SHALL NOT be chosen by type and position alone. A form may carry several text fields,
and the description must not change because an administrator re-ordered them.

The chosen value SHALL have HTML markup and entities stripped, whitespace collapsed, and be cut to
200 characters. When neither a line description nor a qualifying form value exists, the cell SHALL
be empty.

#### Scenario: Line descriptions are joined

- **GIVEN** a document with two lines described `A` and `B`
- **WHEN** the export is produced
- **THEN** its description cell is `A; B`

#### Scenario: A letter-style document is summarised from its form

- **GIVEN** a document whose only line has no description and whose form text field holds
  `<p>ຂໍສະເໜີ&nbsp;ເບີກງົບ</p>`
- **WHEN** the export is produced
- **THEN** its description cell is `ຂໍສະເໜີ ເບີກງົບ`

#### Scenario: The reason is the description even when the subject comes first

- **GIVEN** a document with no line descriptions, whose form has a `subject` field (sort order 1)
  holding `ຈັດຊື້ຄອມ` and a `Reson` field (sort order 2) holding `ເຄື່ອງເກົ່າເພ`
- **WHEN** the export is produced
- **THEN** its description cell is `ເຄື່ອງເກົ່າເພ`

#### Scenario: The subject is never the description

- **GIVEN** a document with no line descriptions whose only text field with a value is `subject`
- **WHEN** the export is produced
- **THEN** its description cell is empty

#### Scenario: A subject found by its label is not the description either

- **GIVEN** a document with no line descriptions whose only text field with a value is named
  `title` and labelled `ເລື່ອງ`
- **WHEN** the export is produced
- **THEN** its description cell is empty

#### Scenario: A differently named text field still serves when there is no reason field

- **GIVEN** a document with no line descriptions whose form has a single text field named `note`
  holding `ຄ່າເດີນທາງ`
- **WHEN** the export is produced
- **THEN** its description cell is `ຄ່າເດີນທາງ`
