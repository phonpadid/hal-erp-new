## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Budget Create and Edit

The web app SHALL let a user holding `BUDGET_MANAGE` propose a budget by dimension and edit an
existing budget's editable attributes (UX only; the server remains authoritative and
company-scoped). Proposing SHALL capture `fiscal_year`, `department`, the `budget_node` the money sits at,
`budget_name`, an optional `gl_account` and `amount_total`, and on save SHALL create a budget plan
carrying that line rather than a spendable budget. The node MAY be chosen from the existing tree or
created inline; a plan is usually written before its structure exists.

The node SHALL be required and SHALL be presented as the budget's identity — its `code` is what a
requester picks it by and what a department head says out loud — while `gl_account` SHALL be
optional and presented as a hint used only to stamp a line that carries no item. The form SHALL NOT
suggest that the account identifies the budget: several budgets legitimately share one account, and
a budget whose spending posts to several accounts records none. A node's parent SHALL be selectable
from nodes of the same fiscal year, and the form SHALL refuse a parent that would make the node its
own ancestor. The node carries no department — the department is the budget's, not the plan line's,
so one plan line can hold two departments' money and a control point can still tell them apart.

The screen SHALL make clear that saving proposes a budget for approval and does not put it in force,
and SHALL take the user to the plan document so they can submit it. Editing SHALL allow changing
`budget_name`, `gl_account` and `status` only; the form SHALL NOT offer `amount_total` for edit,
because usage is derived and `budget.amount_total` is never overwritten (invariant: derived
balances). It SHALL NOT offer the node for edit once the budget exists, because the node is the
identity documents and history refer to it by. `amount_total` SHALL be handled as a string/Decimal
(never a JS number), all labels SHALL come from i18n with en/la parity, and the form SHALL use
PrimeUI theme tokens so it renders in light and dark mode.

The form SHALL NOT offer an over-limit policy or a tolerance ladder. How strictly spending is
checked belongs to the control point governing the budget, not to the budget: a picker here would
edit a ceiling shared with budgets the user is not looking at, from a screen that shows only one of
them — and at the moment this form is filled in, the control point that will govern the budget does
not exist yet.

Saving SHALL be one call to the server. The client SHALL NOT create the budget and then raise its
plan as two requests: a failure between them strands a budget the user cannot then delete, re-propose
or propose again.

The screen SHALL offer re-proposing a `DRAFT` budget that no plan carries, so a stranded row can be
recovered by the person looking at it.

#### Scenario: Create form hidden without BUDGET_MANAGE

- **WHEN** a user holding only `BUDGET_VIEW` opens the budgets list
- **THEN** the "New budget" action and the create route are not available to them

#### Scenario: Proposing a budget by dimension creates a plan

- **GIVEN** a user with `BUDGET_MANAGE`
- **WHEN** they choose a fiscal year, department and node, enter an amount, and save
- **THEN** a budget plan carrying that line is created and the user is taken to the plan document
- **AND** the budget is not spendable

#### Scenario: A budget can be proposed without a GL account

- **GIVEN** a budget whose spending will post to more than one account
- **WHEN** a `BUDGET_MANAGE` user saves it leaving the GL account empty
- **THEN** the form accepts it

#### Scenario: A duplicate node code in the fiscal year is refused before save

- **GIVEN** an existing node with code `1.101` in the chosen fiscal year
- **WHEN** the user creates another node with the same code inline and saves
- **THEN** the form shows a field error and the server rejection is surfaced against the code field

#### Scenario: A parent is chosen from the same fiscal year

- **WHEN** the user opens the parent selector
- **THEN** only nodes of the chosen fiscal year are offered

#### Scenario: The screen says saving proposes rather than sets

- **WHEN** a `BUDGET_MANAGE` user opens the create form
- **THEN** it states that saving submits the budget for approval and does not put it in force

#### Scenario: Edit does not expose amount_total or code

- **WHEN** a `BUDGET_MANAGE` user edits an existing budget
- **THEN** they can change name, GL account and status, but neither `amount_total` nor the node is
  editable
- **AND** the page indicates that changing the budget figure is done through Adjust

#### Scenario: Invalid input is blocked before save

- **WHEN** a required dimension is missing, no node is chosen, or `amount_total` is empty or not a
  positive number
- **THEN** the form shows a field error and does not call the server

#### Scenario: No over-limit policy or ladder is offered

- **WHEN** a `BUDGET_MANAGE` user opens the create or edit form
- **THEN** no over-limit policy field and no tolerance ladder field is shown, and saving sends
  neither

#### Scenario: Saving is one request

- **WHEN** the user saves a proposed budget
- **THEN** one call is made, and a failure leaves no budget behind

#### Scenario: A stranded draft can be re-proposed from the screen

- **GIVEN** a `DRAFT` budget that no plan carries
- **WHEN** a `BUDGET_MANAGE` user opens it
- **THEN** the screen offers to propose it, and doing so takes them to the new plan document
